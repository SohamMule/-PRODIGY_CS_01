# Caesar Cipher
Implementation of Caesar Cipher Program
This is a basic Python program that performs encryption and decryption using the Caesar Cipher technique.

What is Caesar Cipher?
The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter in the message by a certain number of positions in the alphabet.

Features
Encrypts and decrypts text using a shift value between 0 and 25.
Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
Ignores non-alphabetic characters (they remain unchanged).

How to Use
Run the program using Python

Follow the prompts:
Choose whether to encrypt or decrypt.
Enter your message.
Enter the shift value (between 0 and 25).

Example
Caesar Cipher Program
Type 'encrypt' to encrypt, or 'decrypt' to decrypt: encrypt
Enter your message: Hello World
Enter the shift value (0-25): 3
Encrypted message: Khoor Zruog

Requirements
